  ## Description 
  Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 

  ## UserStory 
  ```
  AS A small business owner
  I WANT to be able to write and save notes  SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
  ```
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  ``` 
  GIVEN a note-taking application
  WHEN I open the Note Taker
  THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
  WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
  THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
  WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
  THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
  WHEN I click on the Save icon
  THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
  WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
  THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
